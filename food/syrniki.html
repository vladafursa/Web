   <h1 class="sticky">Сырники(syrniki or pancakes made frome cottage cheese)</h1> 
   <h2>Introduction</h2>
   <div>
    <p>
        Syrniki are these delicious, pillowy-soft, pancakes, made out of farmer’s cheese, also known as tvorog. They are light and fluffy in the center, with a delicate crust on the outside.

Syrniki make a perfect breakfast. While you’re enjoying the most delicious pancakes, you’re also getting a ton of protein. To make it even healthier, top your syrniki with fresh berries or fruit.

You can also treat syrniki as a healthy dessert. Topped with spoonful of sour cream and fruit jam, they can be enjoyed hot or cold.

<h2>Recipe</h2>
<p>
    Place all the tvorog in a saucepan and mix it with a fork, so that there are no large lumps left. Crack the eggs into it, pour in the sugar, and mix everything thoroughly.
    Add 5 heaping tablespoons of flour and mix thoroughly. You can add a little more flour and the syrniki will then turn out more dense. Or a little less flour can be added, and the syrniki will be more tender. Mix until you have a homogeneous mass.
    Put a frying pan over medium heat and pour the sunflower oil in it.
    Put a little flour on a plate. Sculpt a few small balls from the tvorog mixture and put them on the plate. It’s better to mold 4-5 balls at a time ‒ as many as will fit simultaneously in the pan.
    Then flatten them into small cakes (they should not be too thin) and put them in the frying pan.
    Fry the syrniki 1-2 minutes until a golden crust appears. Then turn them over to the other side and also brown until golden.
    Repeat until the mixture is finished.</p>
